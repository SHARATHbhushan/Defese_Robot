# Defese_Robot
This Prototype serves the purpose of a high tech defence robot which can act as a first line of defence for our armed forces as well as can be used for activities in public places and remote locations for reconnaissance. The modern-day neural network and artificial intelligence technologies are deployed in the prototype for higher precision and greater performance.
